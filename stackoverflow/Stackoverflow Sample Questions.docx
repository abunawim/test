I use Laravel framework and I have recently been informed that there is something named database seeding which produces a fake dataset for our tests. Is my understanding correct?

Well that's pretty much odd. How it works? How it knows which type of data do I need in X column of database? And how it generates it?

Also, Can't I make a seed of my real dataset (something like an export)? You know, I don't know English very well, that's why I cannot understand the concept of seed in database field.

I am new to Laravel and have understand the Database Eloquent ORM but not understanding seeding meaning in context of Database.

I am following a tutorial called Incremental API in laracasts by Jeffrey Way.

There is a different coding between Laravel 4 faker class seeding and laravel 5.4.

I still followed the same code lines from the tutorials "Seeders Reloaded". Now, I am stuck with "Class LessonTagTableSeeder does not exist"

Is there any way to define the name of route group in laravel?

What I'm trying to accomplish by this is to know that the current request belongs to which group so I can make active the main menu and sub menu by the current route action:

Code:

……


Now what I want is to call a function or something which will give me the current route's group name.

Examples:

……..

I am new to Laravel and trying to understand the difference between the boot() method and the register() method in Service Provider classes. I have searched all over but haven't been able to find a clear answer. I will really be grateful for a better explanation and kind cooperation.

Sorry if this is very confusing. Any answer will be appreciated.
