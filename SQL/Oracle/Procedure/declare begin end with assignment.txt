:= is the assignment operator in PL/SQL (Oracle's procedural extension to SQL). You use this to assign values to variables. If you just use = then this is checking for equality rather than assigning a value.

Here is a very simple example using the assignment operator to assign values to variables:

Declare
   v1 number;
   v2 number;
   res number;
Begin
   --initialise values
   v1 := 2;
   v2 := 2;
   res := v1 + v2;
   dbms_output.put_line(res);
end;


//Forward slash "/"

It acts as Terminator of the statement.

"/" is only required for PL/SQL blocks or for PL/SQL objects xecuting a DML statement. It is not required for views or tables.


Because ; are used for PL/SQL to end a statement ; cannot be used by SQLPLUS to mean "terminate the current statement, execute it and store it to the SQLPLUS buffer" because we want the whole PL/SQL block to be completely in the buffer, then execute it. PL/SQL blocks must end with:

END;
