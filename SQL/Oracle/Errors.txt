6. Message: oci_fetch_object(): ORA-01830: date format picture ends before converting entire input string

Ans:

I think you should not rely on the implicit conversion. It is a bad practice.

Instead you should try like this:

datenum >= to_date('11/26/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')

//OR
datenum >= date '2013-09-01'

//OR
select * from nm_admission where trunc(entry_timestamp)= to_date('09-sep-2018','dd-mm-rrrr');
select * from nm_admission where to_char(entry_timestamp)= to_date('09-SEP-2018','DD-MM-YY'); //to_char too expensive
