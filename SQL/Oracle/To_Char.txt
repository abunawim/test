Two char needs when one attribute type character and other is number specially in comparing. In the below code, b.LKP_ID is number type so it can be converted into character but a.OCCUPATION is character type so it can not be converted into number

select a.*, b.LKP_NAME as FATHER_OCCU 
from student_gurdianinfo a LEFT JOIN M00_LKPDATA b ON a.OCCUPATION=to_char(b.LKP_ID)
WHERE a.STUDENT_ID=31 AND a.GUARDIAN_TYPE='F';
